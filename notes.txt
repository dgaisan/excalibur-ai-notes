Artificial Intelligence - trying to match capabilities of a human
	- ability to discover
	- ability to reason
	- ability to infer
	- Natural Language Processing
	- Vision
	- text to speech
	- Motion/Robotics

ML(Machine Learning) vs DL(Deep Learning)
	- ML (broader field within artificial intelligence where algorithms learn from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed)

		- Supervised leaning
		- Unsupervised learning
		- Reinforcement learning

	- DL (subset of ML, but itâ€™s more specialized and focused on using neural networks with multiple layers, often called deep neural networks, to automatically learn features and perform complex tasks)
		
		- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
		- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
		- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
