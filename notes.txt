ML(Machine Learning) vs DL(Deep Learning)
	- ML
        - broader field within artificial intelligence where algorithms learn from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed

        - Approaches
		    - Supervised leaning
                - a category of machine learning that uses labeled datasets to train algorithms to predict outcomes and recognize patterns. 
                - unlike unsupervised learning, supervised learning algorithms are given labeled training to learn the relationship between the input and the outputs
		    
            - Unsupervised learning
                - a type of ML that learns from data without human supervision. 
                - unlike supervised learning, unsupervised ML models are given unlabeled data and allowed to discover patterns and insights without any explicit guidance or instruction
		
            - Reinforcement learning
                - type of machine learning that allows machines to learn how to take actions in an environment so as to maximize a reward
	            - mimics the trial-and-error learning process that humans use to achieve their goals

	- DL 
        - subset of ML, but it’s more specialized and focused on using neural networks with multiple layers (often called deep neural networks) to automatically learn features and perform complex tasks
        - enables computers to learn from big data
	    - uses neural nets with many layers
	    - deep learning is not ML (just a subset)
	    - a method in artificial intelligence (AI) that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain
	    - millions examples are given, and the model tries to extract some sense based on the data that it has and input it’s given


        - Types
		    - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
                - type of deep learning model
	            - great for tasks involving images, like recognizing objects or faces 
	            - a CNN is a regularized type of feed-forward neural network that learns features by itself via filter optimization
	            - automatically learning to spot important features in images, such as edges, textures, or shapes, without needing to be manually told what to look for.

		    - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
                - type of deep learning model designed to handle sequential data
	            - great for time series, text, or audio, where the order of the data matters

		    - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
                - GAN is a type of deep learning model used to generate new, realistic data similar to the data it’s trained on.


Data Science
	- Data Engineering 
		- the practice of designing and building systems for collecting, storing, and analyzing data at scale
	- Data analytics/analysis
		- converts raw data into actionable insights. It includes a range of tools, technologies, and processes used to find trends and solve problems by using data
	- Data Mining
		- the overall process of identifying patterns and extracting useful insights from big data sets
	- Data visualization
		- the graphical representation of information and data
	- Data governance
		- integrity, quality, 
	- Business Intelligence (BI)
		- a broad term that encompasses data mining, process analysis, performance benchmarking, and descriptive analytics
	- Big Data
		- extremely large and diverse collections of structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data that continues to grow exponentially over time. 
		- These datasets are so huge and complex in volume, velocity, and variety, that traditional data management systems cannot store, process, and analyze them


Math behind Data Science, ML, DL
    - Vectors: 
        - mathimatical entity that has magnitute (size) and direction. 
        - Normally represented by an array of numbers (x, y) = (3, 2); (x, y, z) = (3, 2, 5)
        - operate in multiple dimensions: (1,2,4,1,2,5,6,7,...) 
        - each value in a vector represents a specific feature
            - a house of 150 sq. m., 4 bedrooms, and 30 years old can look as follows: (150, 4, 30)
            - example of a model weights: [2000, 1000, -500] meaning that the significance of house size has mupliplier of 2000,
                number of rooms has multiplier of 1000, and age is a negative multiplier of -500. 
                Therefore most important feature here is hte size of the house...
            - predicion = weights * vector_values, (2000, 1000, -500) * (150, 4, 30) = 150 * 2000 + 4 * 1000 + 30 * (-500) = 289000: 
                the final value will predict house value
        * ML model is a program that can find patterns or make decisions from a previously unseen dataset.
        * An AI model is a program that has been trained on a set of data to recognize certain patterns or make certain decisions without further human intervention 

    - Matrices
        - 2-dimentional array of numbers, representing multiple Vectors
        - essential for organizing data and making transofrmations 
        - multiplication
            (a, b)   (x, y)   (a * x + b * z)(a * y + b * w)
            (c, d) * (z, w) = (c * x + d * z)(c * y + d * w)
            in resulting matrix for rows we follow first matrix, for columns the second one
        - determinant
            - represents "area" of resulting figure
            - M =   (a, b
                     c, d)
                d(M) = a * d - c * d
            - there are also formulas to calculate determinant for higher dimentions
            - used for figuring out if the columns are linearly related, and it also helps to find the inverse of a matrix.
        - convolutions
            - the process of adding each element of the image to its local neighbors, weighted by the kernel(filter). 
            - This is related to a form of mathematical convolution. 
            - The matrix operation being performed—convolution—is not traditional matrix multiplication
            - Example: blur filter
    
    - Derivative
        - the rate of change of a function with respect to a variable
        - f'(x)
    - Integral
        - the continuous analog of a sum, which is used to calculate areas, volumes, and their generalizations
        - was initially used to solve problems in mathematics and physics, such as finding the area under a curve, or determining displacement from velocity
        - D(f'(x)) = f(x)
